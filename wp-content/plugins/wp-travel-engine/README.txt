= Key Features and Highlights =
1. Unlimited travel packages: There is no limitation on the number of trips. You can add a trip, trip gallery, description, regular price, sales price, duration, unlimited trip facts, FAQs and the cost included and excluded. It also includes itinerary builder. So you can include day-to-day itinerary.

2. Smart Travel Booking Process: The online booking process is smooth, quick and smart. The price automatically gets adjusted based on the number of people selected for booking. The booking form only includes the fields that are necessary, which results in faster booking and more sales!

3. Payment Processing: WP Travel Engine comes with PayPal Standard payment processing. Your customers can book online and you can receive payment easily using your PayPal account. We are working on add-ons for more payment processing. If you have any suggestion or request related to payment processing, please [contact us here](https://wptravelengine.com/support-ticket/).

4. Enquiry form: WP Travel Engine includes an enquiry form on the trip page so that travellers can easily find the form, fill it out and contact you. You can now get more sales enquiries.

5. Booking Email Notification: You can customize the message that your customer receives when they book a trip. Also, every time a traveller books a trip on your website, you too will receive an email notification with all the booking details.

6. Booking Details: The booking information is all saved on your website with all the details of the travellers. You are just a few clicks away whenever you need any booking details or information.

7. Create More Tabs: There already are four tabs (Overview, Itinerary, Costs and FAQs) on each page. If you need more than four tabs on a trip page, easily create them and you can even change their order!

8. Unlimited Trip Facts: You can create unlimited trips ‘Facts’ such as group size, meals, accommodation, the best time to visit and so on, and then add the trip facts to different trips.

9. Destination Page: You can easily create destination pages. For example, London, USA and Japan. So whenever a traveller visits a particular destination page (for example, London), the traveller can see all the trips that belong to that destination.

10. Activities Page: You can create different activities page such as hiking, sightseeing tours, mountain biking, skiing and so on. Then you can connect different trips to these activities.  So when a customer visits your website, not only will they see the various activities that you offer, but they can also see the all the trips that include that activity.
For example, if a customer visits a Hiking page, they will able to see all the trips that include hiking.

11. Trip Type Page: You can even categorize your trips according to their types using WP Travel Engine plugin. You can create different Trip Types and then connect these with your trips.
For example, you can create trip types like dog-friendly, child-friendly, budget travel, nature walk and weekends trips. So when a customer visits a single trip page (for example, dog-friendly), all the trips that are dog-friendly are displayed.
